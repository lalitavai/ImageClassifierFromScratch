# Train an Image Classifier From Scratch

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to train an image classifier from scratch using a deep learning model. The training process follows a structured approach to ensure effective learning and performance improvement.

## Steps for Training a Neural Network
The training process consists of the following steps:

### Step 1 - Understand Your Problem
- Define the classification task.
- Identify the categories/classes for classification.

### Step 2A - Get the Data
- Acquire the dataset for training.
- Ensure data quality and completeness.

### Step 2B - Explore and Understand Your Data
- Visualize sample images from the dataset.
- Analyze class distribution and image properties.

### Step 2C - Create a Sample Dataset
- Extract a small subset of the dataset.
- Use it for quick testing and debugging before full-scale training.

### Step 3 - Data Preparation
- Perform data augmentation.
- Normalize and preprocess the images.
- Split data into training, validation, and test sets.

### Step 4 - Train a Simple Model on Sample Data
- Build a basic neural network.
- Train on the sample dataset.
- Verify the training pipeline before proceeding further.

### Step 5 - Train on Full Data
- Train the model using the entire dataset.
- Monitor loss and accuracy during training.

### Step 6 - Improve Your Model
- Tune hyperparameters.
- Use transfer learning or deeper architectures if necessary.
- Implement regularization techniques (dropout, batch normalization, etc.).

### Step 7 - Generate Submission File
- Make predictions on test images.
- Format the results according to the required submission format.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow or PyTorch
- NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
- OpenCV (for image processing)

## Installation
Run the following command to install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install tensorflow torch numpy pandas matplotlib opencv-python
```

## Running the Training Pipeline
1. Download and preprocess the dataset.
2. Train a simple model on a small subset.
3. Train a deep learning model on the full dataset.
4. Evaluate the model and fine-tune as necessary.
5. Generate predictions and create a submission file.
